Predictive Analytics in Stock Market Trends Using Machine Learning in R
Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques in R to analyze and predict stock market trends. It employs several R scripts that utilize different predictive models and trading strategies to forecast stock prices and simulate trading scenarios.

Dependencies
The project requires the following R packages:

dplyr
ggplot2
tidyr
corrplot
maps
randomForest
neuralnet
shiny
quantmod
TTR (Technical Trading Rules)
forecast
caret
tseries
Make sure to install these packages before running the scripts.

Project Components
1. Simple Trade Setup
File: simple trade setup.R
Description: Establishes a basic trading strategy by identifying potential buy and sell signals based on technical indicators.
2. Trade Simulation
File: Trade Simulation.R
Description: Simulates trading activities based on the predictions from the models and the trade setup strategies.
3. Random Forest Model
File: Random Forest Code.R
Description: Implements a random forest model to predict stock prices based on historical data.
4. Neural Network Model
File: Neural Network.R
Description: Utilizes a neural network to analyze stock market data and predict future trends.
5. Simple Dashboard
File: Simple dashboard.R
Description: Creates an interactive dashboard using Shiny for real-time visualization and analysis of the stock data and forecasts.
Running the Scripts
To run any script, open your R environment and set the working directory to the location of the script and associated data files. Execute the script commands sequentially to reproduce the analysis and simulations.

How to Contribute
